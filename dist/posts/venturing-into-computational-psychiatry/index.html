    <p><p>Next year, provided exams go well, I will be starting my <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/school-life-medical-sciences/intercalated-bsc-programmes-ucl-ibsc">intercalated BSc</a> in Neuroscience. As part of this, I will be undertaking a lab project at the <a href="https://acplab.org">Applied Computational Psychiatry Lab</a>, with whom I worked last summer as well.</p>
<p>Given that I only have nine months to work on this, it seems likely that I will be hyper-focused on a highly scoped project, so I worry that I will be subsumed by minutiae and lose my grip on the bigger picture. To this end, I have been reading Seriès's <em>Computational Neuroscience: A Primer</em>. I have been enjoying the historical view of how this niche has emerged. Its development was less stochastic than I imagined it to be; a handful of researchers, often motivated by powerful personal experience with psychopathology, sought to apply the well-established methods of computational neuroscience to the far murkier waters of phenomenal experience. Emotively, this certainly appeals to my medic-brain: mapping out higher-level emotional circuitry feels far more tangible and urgent.</p>
<p>Equally, I have some scruples. I think I could very easily fall into some conceptual traps while working in this area. The main one is reifying computational <em>models</em> of the mind and treating them as the mind <em>qua</em> itself. Many have dismissed computational approaches altogether on these grounds, but I believe it is possible to apply them to the psyche whilst being aware that you are not capturing anything of the underlying phenomenal state – just systematising some of the inputs and outputs of the state.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the central question I will be taking into this project is whether it is actually possible to make computational models that do not compromise the primacy of patient phenomenology in psychopathology.</p>
<p>Some more basic questions I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do computational models actually help us with in terms of clinical approaches?</li>
<li>What are the major opposing paradigms to circuit-driven accounts of psychopathology?</li>
<li>⁠To what extent is it possible to integrate the strengths of other approaches into the computational paradigm?</li>
</ul>
