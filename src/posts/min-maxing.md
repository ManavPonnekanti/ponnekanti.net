I’ve come to believe that for each respective QoL enhancement there is an optimal level of engagement at which you reap pretty much all of the benefit, and any further cognitive energy and money you funnel into it is just chasing a nonexistent white whale.

In an effort to make hundreds of hours of forum-trawling worth something, below is a list of the various niches I’ve become obsessed with over the years and associated products which I think represent the pragmatic peak. Go no further, just buy it and enjoy it and do more useful things with your time.

## Coffee

- Clever Dripper
  - Follow [this](https://youtu.be/RpOdennxP24?si=u9rJSFD7p9JRxPih) recipe
- Hand-crank grinder
  - Budget: *Hario Skerton*
  - Mid-range: *Timemore C2*
  - High-end: *Comandante C40*
- Bulk purchase “house blend” beans from a home-delivery roaster
- 
## Tea

- Generic cup infuser ([here](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Tea-Infuser-Basket/dp/B07GF4WYGT/ref=sr_1_4?crid=XI8DN97DH3UT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8lgCA83o3K-GNzniLr7x_J1Qe4YtQRR0Lw7019weY0SlipHPOn0XjWVvnF8YbxScfIE1rz7c1CgJzdlR05Gpv2zwTRTIr0rm6dqgR6lRTsEBM1IrPBUemojvQv6BkmCXXusiGflSHrGuWOslFLi2MGnuCiWJLMKZG9ToWBY7je6ISgNnYxPY40stM7GNCOJSb04de0V3iDvmVAWtmU4c0nPzaDt-Tkji8IpEM3-MXS1BqAiGhR1b_sSctZ_hVYFX0DB6rjXtE5qYk2KFbLyTl0ap_5wYvDx5hw_WVR-gPUQ.TBV-b0MteaKkAzURG-I8dX90cbbLua1dvSfxYBwfdQA&dib_tag=se&keywords=tea+basket+brewer&qid=1711901793&sprefix=tea+basket+brewer%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-4) is an example, avoid those small ball infusers)
- If brewing for two or more, use a (clean) french press instead a teapot
- Try green teas, oolongs, and black teas to figure out what you like
  - *Gyokuro* is a Japanese tea, and it is good representative for greens
  - *Jin Xuan*, also known as ‘milk oolong’ is Chinese, and is worth trying for its naturally creamy flavour — in a good milk oolong, no milk is actually used in the preparation process
  - *Darjeeling* is a good representative for Indian black teas
- Pick a vendor from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and you’ll probably end up with something good

## Mechanical keyboards

- Anything from [*Keychron*](https://www.keychron.com/) that fits your preferred keyboard layout and size
- In terms of key switches:
  - Clicky (blue) if you want something loud and mechanical-feeling, avoid if you are going to use in a communal space
  * Tactile (brown) if you just want to type — middle of the road option
  - Linear (red/yellow) if you are going to game on your computer
- [*Unicomp*](https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/SFNT) make replicas of the IBM Model M buckling spring keyboards; loud but an unbeatable typing experience

## Shaving

- *Merkur 34C* safety razor and whatever canned shaving foam you prefer
- Get a blade sampler pack from somewhere like [here](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/collections/razor-blades-sample-packs)
  - Make sure to get one with *Personna* blades since they are gentle and a good way to learn without cutting yourself, but you will probably end up wanting something more aggressive

## Writing implements

- Fountain pens
  - *Lamy Safari* with the *Z28* converter to use bottled ink (if you hold your pen conventionally)
  - The *Platinum Preppy* is even cheaper and is more forgiving of non-typical pen grips
  - For inks, everything from *Diamine* is good
- Ballpoint: *Uniball Jetstream*
- Rollerball: *Pilot Precise V5/V7*
- Gel: *Pentel EnerGel*
- Pencil: *Staedler 925 35-05* with *Pentel Hi Polymer Super 0.5mm 2B* lead

## Headphones

- *Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro* 80-ohm
  - If you have a Mac, you don’t need a DAC
  - If you don’t, then purchase the *FiiO K3* and the 256-ohm version of these headphones

## Printers

- Any black-and-white *Brother* laser printer, and use it wired if you can
- Not even AGI will solve printer wireless networking
