![Y.G. Srimati's depiction of deities](/yg-srimati-deities.jpg)
I came across her works by chance: a girl at uni did a presentation on her, and I was instantly smitten (with Srimati, not the girl, to be clear). A remarkable woman, criminally under-appreciated. She's sort of adjacent to, certainly contemporary to, the Contextual Modernists of Santiniketan, but her work doesn't quite fit into that milieu. It seems wrong to even think of her work 'conceptually'. Regardless of her style and artistic affectation, she's clearly a devotional artist. The intimacy with which she represents her deities does not strike me as artistic liberty or an attempt to raise eyebrows. I see in her works a sweet honesty, a true acquaintance with the numinous.
