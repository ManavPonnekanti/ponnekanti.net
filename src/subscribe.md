There is no fancy automated newsletter â€“ when I publish a new post on here, I manually send it out as a BCC email to everyone on the mailing list. So, if you are particularly enthusiastic, email me anything at `manav at ponnekanti dot net` after you sign up. This will prevent my emails from being flagged at spam.


If you use an RSS reader, a [feed](/feed.xml) is also available.
