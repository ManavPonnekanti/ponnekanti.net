## By Email

Click [here](https://feedrabbit.com/signup?return_url=%2Fsubscriptions%2Fnew%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fponnekanti.net%252Ffeed.xml) to subscribe via FeedRabbit.

FeedRabbit is a service that sends new posts (and nothing else!) to your inbox whenever they are published, without the usual ads, tracking, and telemetry rubbish that accompanies most email newsletters. This means you can lie to me about reading them and I will be none the wiser.

After clicking the link and entering your email, hit subscribe and you will receive a confirmation email. Click the link in the email to confirm your subscription.

## By RSS

If you have an RSS reader, the feed URL is [https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml](https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml).
