Click [here](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Fponnekanti.net%2Ffeed.xml) to subscribe via Feedrabbit.

Feedrabbit is an RSS-to-email service. This means that it sends new posts to your email whenever they are published. The emails look like this:

Unlike newsletter services like Substack, there are no ads or tracking and it's unidirectional â€“ I can't see who subscribes. This means you can lie to me about reading my posts and I will be none the wiser.

After clicking the link and creating a Feedrabbit account, hit subscribe and you will receive a confirmation email. Make sure to click the link in there to start receiving posts.

If you use an RSS reader, you can just access the feed directly. The feed URL is [https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml](/feed.xml).
