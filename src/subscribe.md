## By Email

Click [here](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Fponnekanti.net%2Ffeed.xml) to subscribe via Feedrabbit.

Feedrabbit is an RSS-to-email service. This means that it sends new posts to your email whenever they are published. The emails look like this:

Unlike newsletter services like Substack, it's invisible – there are no ads or tracking and I can't see who subscribes. This means you can lie to me about reading my posts and I will be none the wiser.

After clicking the link and creating a Feedrabbit account, hit subscribe and you will receive a confirmation email. Make sure to click the link in there to start receiving posts.

## By RSS

If you use an RSS reader, you can just access the feed directly. The feed URL is [https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml](https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml).

> RSS (one of those ancient internet acronyms with multiple definitions, including, but not limited to, “Really Simple Syndication”) is an invisible, automatic way for internet-connected systems to public “feeds.” For example, rather than reloading the *Wired* homepage every day and trying to figure out which stories are new (their layout makes this very hard to do!), you can just sign up for *Wired*’s RSS feed, and use an RSS reader to monitor the site and preview new stories the moment they’re published. *Wired* pushes about 600 words from each article into that feed, stripped of the usual stuff that makes *Wired* nearly impossible to read: no 20-second delay subscription pop-up, text in a font and size of your choosing. You can follow *Wired*’s feed without any cookies, and *Wired* gets no information about which of its stories you read. *Wired* doesn’t even get to know that you’re monitoring its feed.
