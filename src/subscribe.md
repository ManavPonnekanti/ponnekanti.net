title: Subscribing to new posts

## By Email

Click [here](https://feedrabbit.com/signup?return_url=%2Fsubscriptions%2Fnew%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fponnekanti.net%252Ffeed.xml) to subscribe via FeedRabbit.

FeedRabbit is a service that sends new posts (and nothing else!) to your inbox whenever they are published, without the usual ads, tracking, and telemetry rubbish that accompanies most email newsletters. This means you can lie to me about reading them and I will be none the wiser.

When you press `subscribe` you will be prompted to enter your email and create an account (if you don't have one already). Make sure to click the link in the confirmation email to start receiving my posts.

## By RSS

If you have an RSS reader, the feed URL is [https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml](https://ponnekanti.net/feed.xml).
