title: About
---
I'm a medical student at UCL interested in computational approaches to behavioural neuroscience and psychiatry. I am also inclined towards phenomenological psychopathology: taking the first-person report of mental illness evidentially seriously and investigating the structure of subjectivity. Finding continuity between these two paradigms is my primary academic goal â€“ *ars longa, vita brevis*. 

My blog-posts span the above as well as various non-medical interests ([disclaimer](/disclaimer)). You can contact me via email at:

## Previous Work

- Training large language models on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 responses in an effort to surface clinically useful latent factors that influence self-report at the [Applied Computational Psychiatry Lab](https://acplab.org/)
- Identifying novel congenital cataract-causing variants using the NGS pipeline (paper available [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38957147/))
- Innovation Fellow at [Avronna](https://avronna.com), which involved ML development for pharmaceutical R&D, pitching to VCs, and preparing material and copy for said pitches
- Developing a synthetic degradation model for retinal fundus images to generate robust pairwise training data for image enhancement networks at [Pontikos Lab](https://pontikoslab.com/)
- Analysing the video output of the adaptive optics laser scanning ophthalmoscope at [Michaelides Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/research/research-labs-and-groups/michaelides-lab)
